<ul style = "font-size: .8em;"><h3><?php echo $title;?>- Hints/Help</h3>

<li>  The sold rows do not disappear from the 'Recon' view automatically (but could be changed to do that).  This may be a task for Friday afternoon, where you select the sold records,click the edit button and uncheck the 'On Recon' field. This will remove them from the recon view. This is in case there are sold units that should still be on recon after the sale is recorded in our system.  (I&apos;ve done for this week&apos;s sales, already. (Sale-date: June 2, 2017) I&apos;ve also updated the RunDate for any rows that had a Lane/Run number assigned, and did not sell, from the 2nd to 9th of June. </li>
