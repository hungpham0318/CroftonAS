<ul style = "font-size: .8em;"><h3>General Hints/Help</h3>
<li>You can only select and EDIT 25 records at a time. (I&apos;m looking into the reason for this, but it may just be a function of the amount of data being manipulated in memory(-as opposed to storage).)
</li><br/>
<li>The 'Excel' and 'Copy' buttons next to 'Edit' will include the selected rows and visible columns.   They are both handy for sending data into a spreadsheet.  The Excel button produces a NEW WORKBOOk, while the Copy button COPIES to your clipboard and can then be pasted (ctrl-v) into an existing workbook or Google Sheet(s). The 25-row-limit does not apply to copying, nor to the Excel option.  One caveat, however, is that the header row is copied and pasted as well, so allow for that when pasting. (Then just delete the row afterward if you don&apos;t want it in the destination sheet.  (I&apos;m in the process of trying to exclude the header row for copied rows.))
</li><br/>
<li>The sort order for this page is done by clicking in the header of the columns.  When you click it toggles up or down.  You can achieve multiple sorting by holding the shift key and clicking header columns in the order you wish.  An example would be the table being sorted first by Dealership (Up) and Submitted dated (also Up) which would give you the Dealerships alphabetically followed by the submitted date with oldest first in each dealership group. So to accomplish this, first click the Dealership header until the arrow points upward, and then press the shift key and hold while clicking Submitted Date column header until the arrow points upward. (You can continue to sort by as many columns as you wish)

<li>Most of these views will retain your preferences between visits for things like sort order and column visibility.  These preferences are actually stored by the browser, and therefore, when the browser cache is cleared, the page preferences will revert to the original page creation preferences.  Also, different browsers do not share their cache so different browsers show preferences only set from within that specific browser.   To see how the page was originally set, just open the site in an incognito window because they store no browser information from session to session.  You will have to log in again in incognito view.
